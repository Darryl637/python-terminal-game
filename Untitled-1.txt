Notes:

Create directions instead of integers for moving from room to room

create command that can be entered to make a room. Command asks for direction, name and desc. 
Thoughts on aproaches to this...was thinking to add to dictionary with function but we create a new function for each option of movement how can I generalize the movement functions 
to eliminate the redundent go_to code for each room.

Played with ANSI color \033[92m and looked at colorama and termcolor after importing these can I tie the ANSI to a different command.
example -> (&RRed text&z) <---This &R makes string red &z returns to default color to continue. The idea with setting this up is to have the ability to use these colors inside other functions
like you can make an item and in naming that item manipulate the colors of the test since this is graphicless 
I think colors make it more fun and appealing to the eye instead of reading black text on white screen
